  * Fix various issues with PHP 8.0
  * Fix some dao locales that have a bad pattern for sprintf

  * New option `force_new` in profiles for pgsql to force a new connection

* Fix some issues in the docker stack for tests
* Upgrade PHPUnit to 8.5.14

Because there is not a version of PHPUnit that is compatible with PHP 5.6, 7.x and 8.0
at the same time, Jelix 1.7 cannot be tested any more against PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.1.
So, starting from this version, there is no more guarantee that Jelix 1.7 works 
well on these old version of PHP. However, bug fixes and minor improvements in this
branch will not use specific syntax of PHP 7.3+/8.x, so it could not be an issue.

Anyway, it is higly recommanded to migrate to PHP 7.3 or higher, as PHP 7.2 and
lower are not maintained any more by the PHP team. See https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php.

Jelix 1.7.6
-----------

* have all bug fixes and improvements from Jelix 1.6.30.
    * Fix basePath in the context of a command line script
    * Fix a PHP error in the listbox form widget
    * Fix a issue in jAcl2 admin: an administrator could put himself into a group which forbid some admin rights, and so he was not an administrator anymore.
    * new command to test the mailer. To send an email to check mailer parameters, 
      execute `php console.php mailer:test my.email@example.com`
    * jForms: new control jControlTime, and support of a `<time>` element in jforms 
    * New method `jEvent::getParameters()`

    * New methods `jServer::getDomainName()`, `jServer::getServerURI()`, 
      `jServer::getPort()`, `jServer::isHttps()`

* jAcl2: adapter system to make the glue to authentication.    
  It allows to use authentication library other than jAuth, like
  the jelix/authentication-module library.
* jAcl2: reword terms 'role' to 'right'. Rewording 'subject' to 'role' into Jelix 1.7 was a mistake.
  So some API have been renamed, but old API are still usable, even if deprecated.

  - `jAcl2DbManager::removeRole()` becomes `deleteRight()`
  - `jAcl2DbManager::removeRole()` becomes `deleteRight()`

  - `jAcl2DbManager::addRoleGroup()` becomes `createRightGroup()`
  - `jAcl2DbManager::removeRoleGroup()` becomes `deleteRightGroup()`

  - dao method `jacl2rights::deleteByRoleRes()` becomes `deleteByRightRes()`
  - dao method `jacl2rights::deleteByRole()` becomes `deleteByRight()`
  - dao method `jacl2rights::deleteByGroupAndRoles()` becomes `deleteByGroupAndRights()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::findAllRoles()` becomes `findAllRights()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::removeRolesFromGroup()` becomes `removeRightsFromRightsGroup()`
  - dao method `jacl2subject::replaceRoleGroup()` becomes `replaceRightsGroup()`
  - console command `acl2:role-create` becomes `acl2:right-create`
  - console command `acl2:role-delete` becomes `acl2:right-delete`
  - console command `acl2:role-group-create` becomes `acl2:rights-group-create`
  - console command `acl2:role-group-delete` becomes `acl2:rights-group-delete`
  - console command `acl2:role-group-list` becomes `acl2:rights-groups-list`
  - console command `acl2:roles-list` becomes `acl2:rights-list`
